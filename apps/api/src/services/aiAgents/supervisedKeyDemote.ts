/**
 * P2-5 (#4192, Task A2-6) — the DEMOTE executor, the mirror of
 * `supervisedKeyGrant.ts`.
 *
 * The one and only writer that REMOVES a colon key from an organization's
 * `ai_agents.actAssets.supervisedActionKeys`. Two AUTOMATIC events reach it,
 * and they are the two ways an unattended operation proves it should not have
 * been unattended:
 *
 *   - an ATTEMPTED failure of a released intent (`intentReleaseWorker.ts` —
 *     the terminal write stamped `executed_at`, so the provider-side call
 *     really happened and really failed);
 *   - a fix-watch `recurred` verdict (`fixWatch.ts` — the fix did not hold).
 *
 * A third caller is a HUMAN: `POST /ai/agents/graduation/revoke`
 * (`routes/aiAgents.ts`) with `reason: 'operator'`, the operator-facing
 * mirror of promote. It carries no `runId`/`watchId` — there is no
 * disqualifying evidence, only a decision — and it deliberately does NOT
 * notify (see `notifyDemotion`). Everything below applies to it unchanged
 * except the savepoint: the route holds no evidence transaction to nest in,
 * so it takes the `database` default and this executor opens its own system
 * context.
 *
 * Three properties make this safe to run unattended, and all three are the
 * reason it exists as its own module rather than as a second half of
 * `supervisedKeyGrant.ts`:
 *
 * 1. **ALWAYS ON.** Unlike the promote executor it never consults
 *    `BREEZE_AI_AGENTS_POLICY_DECIDE_ENABLED`. Flipping the flag off stops
 *    new grants; it must never strand an existing one on an agent whose last
 *    attempt failed.
 *
 * 2. **It rides the transaction that recorded the negative evidence.** Both
 *    callers hand it the executor of a SAVEPOINT nested inside the
 *    transaction that just wrote the `failed` / `recurred` row, so on the
 *    happy path the revoke and the evidence that justifies it commit
 *    together, while a revoke failure rolls back to that savepoint and is
 *    Sentry-captured rather than unwinding a terminal state (an already-
 *    executed action in the release worker; a recurrence verdict a human
 *    needs to see in `fixWatch`). That is what
 *    the `database` parameter is for — the same shape `insertOpEvidence` and
 *    `createIntentFixWatchRow` already use, and for the same reason: a
 *    statement issued through the AMBIENT `db` proxy inside a savepoint goes
 *    to the OUTER scope, where postgres-js records its failure and rethrows
 *    it at scope end even if the caller caught it, aborting the terminal CAS
 *    of an action that already ran.
 *
 * 3. **Its import closure stays clean.** `fixWatch.ts` is the only real
 *    dependency of `fixWatchWorker`, a `global`-placement worker
 *    (`services/workerRegistry.ts`) that
 *    `workerEntrypointClosure.contract.test.ts` forbids from reaching
 *    `routes/agentWs.ts` / `services/agentCommandAwait.ts`. Putting the
 *    revoke in `supervisedKeyGrant.ts` would import that whole graph into
 *    `fixWatch.ts`: the promote executor needs `agentService.withAgentRowLocked`,
 *    `agentService.ts` imports `actionIntents/policyDecidable`, and that
 *    reaches `aiTools.ts` and thence the route graph. Verified, not assumed —
 *    the same reasoning `graduationService.ts`'s header records for
 *    `policyDecidableKeys.ts`.
 *
 * Tenancy: the whole executor runs under a system context (the partner
 * baseline row is invisible to an org-scoped reader), so — per this repo's
 * invariant — every statement predicates on `org_id` / `partner_id`
 * explicitly even though RLS passes unconditionally there. `agentId` is never
 * trusted on its own: it is re-pinned through the organization's OWN partner
 * before it is allowed to name a `kind`.
 *
 * Leak rules: the audit row and the notification carry identifiers only —
 * the agent name, the op key, ids, a reason enum. Never a tool result, an
 * alert message, or any model-authored text.

 *

 * automated signal from one org may make. A key held only by that ceiling
 * therefore has nothing to revoke: the effective grant for an org with no

 * is written — no graduation row, no audit, no notification. Recording a

 * `demoted_at` window clamp) on a tuple that never graduated.
 *
 * Notification is the CALLER's job, strictly AFTER the transaction commits —
 * see `notifyDemotion`.
 *
 * Ordering is load-bearing. The tuple's advisory lock is taken first and held
 * for the rest of the transaction, then the ORG row's own `SELECT … FOR
 * UPDATE`. That is the same order `authorizeSupervisedKey` uses (advisory
 * lock, then row locks), which is what makes a promote/demote deadlock
 * structurally impossible rather than merely unlikely. The row lock — not the
 * advisory lock — is also what excludes a concurrent operator `PATCH`, since
 * `withAgentRowLocked` (`agentService.ts`) locks the very same row before its
 * own read-modify-write of this jsonb column.
